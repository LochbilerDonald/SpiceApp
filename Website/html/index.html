        Spice is here to help you find your next dining experience! You can create
        a user profile to customize the results based on your preferences. Users
        can also invite each other to events where we handle finding the best experience
        based on a groups overall prefences. Users could also find a restaurant
        without preferences, Spice it up, to get something out of the ordinary
        to break up the monotony.
